    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
	
3) Install gh-pages by following command
npm i gh-pages

4) then execute the below command

5) if the site is not live at url https://siddharthpaul20.github.io/my-portfolio,
then do one more step

go to the github website to your repo my-portfolio, under the settings tab, choose theme to set, and set Cayman theme, these will resolve 404 error issue.

In case anyone gets stuck with v3.1.0, the cache directory is now at node_modules/.cache/gh-pages https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages/blob/v3.1.0/changelog.md#v310

delete gh-pages folder in above path ,in case of error gh-pages branch already exists
